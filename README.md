AutoReverseShellBinaryGenerator

Auto generate reverse shell binary

if you can't use msfvenom, maybe this script is so usefuly.

but now this can generate elf  file only.....

Usage:

     shellbin <lhost> <lport>

SetUp:
  
     if root user      :  python3 setup.py
     if not a root user:  sudo python3 setup.py


Auto generate as "shell.c" and "shell.elf"
So becareful to current files name on working directory
